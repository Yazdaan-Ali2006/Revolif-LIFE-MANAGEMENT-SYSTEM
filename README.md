## 📖 Overview

**Revolif** is a full-featured personal productivity and life-management system. It combines task scheduling, goal tracking, expense/budget management, an achievements system, a focus/Pomodoro-style timer, and an admin control panel — all wrapped in a modern, animated QML interface backed by a robust object-oriented C++ engine.

The project started as a console-based OOP system in C++ and evolved into a complete **Qt Quick desktop application**, with the original console logic re-engineered into a reusable backend that now drives a fully graphical UI.

## 🏗️ Architecture

Revolif follows a clean separation between UI and logic:

```
QML Frontend  ⇄  RevolifController (C++/Qt bridge)  ⇄  System Backend (Core Engine)
```

- **QML Frontend** — Declarative UI (pages, dialogs, reusable components)
- **RevolifController** — `Q_INVOKABLE` bridge exposing backend functionality to QML
- **Core Backend (`revolif_backend.cpp`)** — Pure C++ engine containing the domain model, file persistence, business rules, and email service
- **Qt Data Models** — `QAbstractListModel` implementations (`TaskListModel`, `GoalListModel`, `ExpenseListModel`) for efficient list binding in QML

### Core Domain Classes

| Class | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `User` | User profile, stats, streaks, achievements |
| `Task`, `AcademicTask`, `DailyTask` | Task hierarchy with polymorphic behavior |
| `TaskManager` | Task CRUD, filtering, overdue detection |
| `Goal`, `GoalManager` | Goal lifecycle management |
| `Expense`, `ExpenseManager` | Expense tracking & budgets |
| `Achievement` | Unlockable milestone system |
| `ActivityLog`, `ActivityLogManager` | Streaks & heatmap data |
| `Admin` | Administrative privileges & actions |
| `Authentication` | Login, registration, password verification |
| `EmailManager` | SMTP email dispatch (welcome/summary emails) via libcurl |
| `System` | Central orchestrator — file I/O, session state, report generation |

Custom exception classes (`FileException`, `NotFoundException`, `UserException`, `AuthException`, `ValidationException`) provide structured error handling throughout the engine.

🙏 Acknowledgment

Revolif was built through genuine hands-on effort  architecture, logic, and design decisions were ours — with AI tools (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.) used along the way for debugging, boilerplate, and speeding up development. We believe in being transparent about that process.
